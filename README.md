# control-module
Code used to run control module on Space Demon extraterrestrial vessel

## Main Conductor
- The code is hosted on an 8t1 plasma coil. You might get away with the recent qlow-N body clones but it's untested. 
- All expletives need to be declared on initialisation of the launch sequence. 
- A general curvature of 61 degrees is required to maintain launch atmospherics.
- We went with a trial-and-error process to obtain all GST navigation dentures but you might just get away with 91 pots.
- Second-order neural graph sensors can be used to instantiate docking planks.


## Faraday Gauge
- Possible contanimation from P-tunnel shortages.
- Excitors can be of any rotation.

- Wheel house will need an interface of Y-gen influence not greater than 1G.

## Power Compartment
- The tensile loops of the compartment are primal.
- We used teh following induction script to boot the monk mechanisma: 
```
  If (Green) -> Please.Launch
  If (Red) -> You.Stop
  When (R) <- Be.True
 ```
